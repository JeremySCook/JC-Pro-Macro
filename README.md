**!! After initial install, GND and RST pins may need to be shorted together  
momentarily to reset after hitting upload in the Arduino IDE for reprogramming.  
Quickly resetting twice in sequence may give you more time to load the program !!**

I2C pins are broken out and arranged for use with SSD1306-based OLED screens  
Current program includes diagnostic code for this type of screen.  
2 additional GPIO pins, as well as GND and +5V are broken out, giving a total  
of 4 GPIO pins that can be used to control external devices (perhaps a small fan)
