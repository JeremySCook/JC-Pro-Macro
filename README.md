I2C pins are broken out and arranged for use with SSD1306-based OLED screens  
Current program includes diagnostic code for this type of screen.  
2 additional GPIO pins, as well as GND and +5V are broken out, giving a total  
of 4 GPIO pins that can be used to control external devices (perhaps a small fan)
