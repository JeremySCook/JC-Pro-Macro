## Experimental Code

ProMacro-5-fan.ino includes a PWM output for the broken out pins on the right side that aligns with a standard PC PWM fan.
Allows you to change the fan's speed from 0 - off to 5 - full power. Routines for Slither.io and dedicated fan display
are in the code, but disabled. Code/fan works, but power requirements have not been mearsured so use at your own risk.

Tested with a 12V Noctua fan: https://amzn.to/3jjgQIV (Amazon).
5V version moves more air, https://amzn.to/3A8RofR (Amazon) though color scheme is questionable.

## Experimental Music Mode

ProMacro-6-music.ino allows you to connect a small speaker to GPIO pin 7 to play a number of notes.
