## Standard Code

Current standard code (ProMacro.ino) is written and tested on a Macintosh -  
should work with a PC or Linux, possibly with some modifications.

Includes a mode for media control and browser tabbing, as well as a "jiggle" mode to keep your computer awake.

Note that after initial install, GND and RST pins may need to be shorted together  
momentarily after hitting upload in the Arduino IDE in order to reprogram.

## Experimental 

ProMacro-4-slither.ino includes a third mode for playing slither.io. Tab through modes with encoder button.
align the mouse with the head of worm and press upper-right keyboard button. You can then steer the worm with the encoder
and speed up with the three bottom buttons.
